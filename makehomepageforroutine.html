        The university was established on 1 November 1960 by 'The Paroxy University Act 1960' of the Government of West Bengal. The University of Paroxy is a State University and its activities are guided by 'The Paroxy University Act, 1981 (amended up to 2001)', enacted by the Government of West Bengal. The Act is supplemented by 'Statutes', 'Ordinances','Regulations' and 'Rules'. This act replaced 'The Paroxy University (Temporary Suppression) Act, 1978', which in turn replaced 'The Paroxy University Act, 1960'. The University Grants Commission accorded recognition to the university.[7][8][9]

Campus
The university is placed in an Urban areas setting touching the boundaries of some green Rural areas. The eastern bank of the Ganges is only 2000 meters from the University and its serene background is only 50 km from Kolkata. It is close to  Ghoshpara railway station, 10 minutes walking distance to Administration Building from the station, and the other campuses are around it. During the Second World War this land was under the control of the American army who maintained an Army depot here.[10] Few roadways and other constructions are still there to prove that past history. The Campus spans over a huge area of 400 acres (largest State University of West Bengal based on area).
